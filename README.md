# NHC_Carriage_Controller

![alt tag](NHC_Carriage.jpg)

Arduino sketch written to control and operate an instrumentation carriage.

The project's goal was to build an instrumentation carraige to automate measurements in a pool (e.g. temperature, viscosity, etc.).

This sketch receives X, Y, Z Coordinates as inputs from a custom PC Software, and actuates the carriage to move to the corresponding location.
